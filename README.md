Konix Multisystem - Attack Of The Mutant Camels '89 V0.4 - Source Code

This repository contains the source assets / code from the Konix Multisytem project - Attack Of The Mutant Camels '89

The code is released with the kind permission of its original author - Jeff Minter

The tree also contains the assembler I wrote to actually build the image, it is incomplete only containing enough
functionality to assemble this and a few other projects that were donated. The first task for anyone thinking of
continuing the development will be to modify it to assemble with a more complete assembler, and write a tool to convert
the assembled code into the rom format used by the slipstream emulator - see wiki
